Task 0:
Write a function that produces output according to a format.

Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
write output to stdout, the standard output stream
format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
c
s
%
You don’t have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function
You don’t have to handle the flag characters
You don’t have to handle field width
You don’t have to handle precision
You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

Task 1:
Handle the following conversion specifiers:

d
i
You don’t have to handle the flag characters
You don’t have to handle field width
You don’t have to handle precision
You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

Task 2:
Handle the following custom conversion specifiers:

b: the unsigned int argument is converted to binary

Task 3:
Handle the following conversion specifiers:

u
o
x
X
You don’t have to handle the flag characters
You don’t have to handle field width
You don’t have to handle precision
You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

Task 4:
Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible.

Task 5:
Handle the following custom conversion specifier:

S : prints the string.
Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters)
